EasyCSV Import.py is a python script that will quickly and easily import a large .csv file into your mySQL database from the command line.

I use this script all the time at home so I though I might share it with my github friends :)

I will most likely update this script often. I would like to write a TK gui for it and add more features too it. 

I pretty much use this script for importing very large csv files that would require a php config file change in order to upload due to max file size, max script execution time
and whatever other limitations php puts on me. The goal is to write it in a way that will be very fast and efficient so that I can load gigs of data into mySQL at a time.
